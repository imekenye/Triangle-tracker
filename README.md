## Behaviour Driven Development
### 1. Behaviour
#### Our program should handle:
All triangle sides must be equal.

##### INPUT EXAMPLE: SIDE A = 2 SIDE B = 2 SIDE C = 2
##### OUTPUT EXAMPLE: Equilateral Triangle all sides are equal.

### 2. Behaviour
#### Our program should handle:
Two triangle sides must be equal.

##### INPUT EXAMPLE: SIDE A = 2 SIDE B = 2 SIDE C = 4
##### OUTPUT EXAMPLE: Isoceles Triangle two sides are equal.

### 3. Behaviour
#### Our program should handle:
None of the sides are be equal.However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.

##### INPUT EXAMPLE: SIDE A = 2 SIDE B = 4 SIDE C = 3
##### OUTPUT EXAMPLE: Scalene Triangle none of the sides are equal.
